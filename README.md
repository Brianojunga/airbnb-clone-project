üè† **Airbnb Clone Backend**

**üöÄ Overview**


The Airbnb Clone Backend is a robust and scalable backend system to manage users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It is a simple implementation of the backend functionality found in Airbnb, allowing its users to interact securely and easily, effectively manage users and data, and integrate APIs for front-end or mobile application architectures.


**üèÜ Project Goals**


1. User Management: Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile handling.
2. Property Management: Enable users to list, update, and manage property details.
3. Booking System: Allow users to reserve properties, manage check-ins, and view booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate secure payment handling for property bookings.
5. Review System: Let users rate and review properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient performance through caching, indexing, and optimized queries.


**‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack**

      Backend Framework: Django
      
      API Framework: Django REST Framework (REST) + GraphQL
      
      Database: PostgreSQL
      
      Asynchronous Tasks: Celery
      
      Caching & Session Management: Redis
      
      Containerization: Docker
  
      Deployment & CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
